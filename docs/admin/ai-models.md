## What this tab controls

Controls chat, embedding, image generation, and multi-endpoint model routing for the application.

## Why it matters

These settings decide which model endpoints receive prompts, embeddings, and image-generation requests. If GPT settings are wrong, chat and agents fail. If embeddings are wrong, workspace retrieval and document search fail. Multi-endpoint routing and user-selectable models are powerful, but they also widen the cost, quota, and governance surface because different deployments may have different capabilities and data-handling expectations.

### Multi-endpoint model management

Enable multi-endpoint mode when different deployments, providers, or model families should be managed together. After enabling it, choose a fallback model so background tasks and agents that do not specify a model still have a safe default.

### Embeddings configuration

Embeddings are required for document retrieval and workspace search. Configure and test embeddings before telling users to upload searchable documents; otherwise files may upload but retrieval-backed answers will not work correctly.

### Image generation

Image generation sends user prompts to the configured image model deployment. Keep it off unless the deployment has quota, content policy approval, and a model selected for image generation.

## Before you change anything

- Create the Azure OpenAI, Foundry, or APIM endpoints and know each deployment name before adding it.
- For managed identity authentication, grant the app identity access to the OpenAI or Foundry resource before saving.
- Configure embeddings before enabling document retrieval experiences that depend on vector search.
- For multi-endpoint mode, decide which model is the default fallback before users start creating agents.

## Common tasks

1. **Add or review chat model routing.**
    1. Enable **Enable multi-endpoint model management** if using the endpoint manager.
    2. Add or verify chat endpoints and deployments in **Model Endpoints** or legacy **Chat Model** fields.
    3. Choose **Default model for fallbacks**.
    4. Save and open Chat to verify the model selector.
    Outcome to verify: Users can select the intended chat deployments.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

2. **Configure embeddings for workspaces.**
    1. Set **Use APIM instead of direct to Azure OpenAI endpoint** if embeddings route through APIM.
    2. Enter the embedding endpoint, authentication type, API version, and deployment details.
    3. Provide key or managed identity subscription/resource group values as required.
    4. Save and run the connection test.
    Outcome to verify: Workspace search has a working embedding deployment.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

3. **Enable image generation.**
    1. Enable **Enable Image Generation**.
    2. Configure direct Azure OpenAI or APIM image-generation endpoint fields.
    3. Select authentication type and provide the key or managed identity details.
    4. Save and verify the image generation control appears only for intended users.
    Outcome to verify: Image prompts route to the configured image model.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users do not see models in chat | No active GPT deployment or endpoint is configured. | Configure a chat endpoint and deployment, then save settings and refresh chat. |
