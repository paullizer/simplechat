## What this tab controls

Controls branding, home page copy, navigation defaults, user notices, health checks, support menu entries, external links, and global app behavior.

## Why it matters

This tab shapes the experience every user sees before they ever open a workspace: the app name, landing page, navigation, legal notices, access-denied copy, support links, and upload/session limits. A branding change is low risk, but health-check exposure, Terms of Use frequency, idle timeout, and maximum file size can affect monitoring, sign-in flows, compliance evidence, and whether large uploads or long-running chats succeed.

### Terms of use

Enable this when users must acknowledge local terms before continuing. Changing the title, message, or frequency creates a new version, so previously accepted users may be prompted again. Configure the decline redirect before enabling it so users who cancel land somewhere intentional.

### Idle session timeout

Idle timeout is a local app logout control. Set the warning time lower than the logout timeout if users should have a chance to keep working; set it equal to the timeout only when you intentionally do not want a warning window.

## Before you change anything

- Have approved public-facing text for the landing page, access-denied message, Terms of Use, AI notice, and support links.
- If enabling unauthenticated `/external/healthcheckz`, confirm the monitoring system and security team expect a no-auth endpoint.
- If enabling Terms of Use, decide whether users must accept once, every session, or after text changes.
- If changing idle timeout, choose values that leave enough warning time before local logout.
