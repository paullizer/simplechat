## What this tab controls

Provides admin-side forms for reporting bugs and feature requests to the SimpleChat team.

## Why it matters

This page gives admins a structured way to report bugs and feature requests with contact and organization context. It is not an end-user feature toggle; its value is in producing reproducible, routed feedback instead of informal messages with missing details.
