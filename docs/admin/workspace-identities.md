## What this tab controls

Provides the administration surface for shared identity mappings used by workspace connectors and sync sources.

## Why it matters

Global identities exist so connectors and sync sources can reuse approved identity profiles instead of each source carrying its own credentials. The risk is concentrated: a misconfigured shared identity can grant every source that uses it access to the wrong external location.

## Settings

This tab does not expose individual saved form fields in `admin_settings.html`; it is an operational surface for managing shared workspace identities.

## Before you change anything

- Inventory the managed identities or app registrations that sync sources are allowed to reuse.
- Confirm each identity has the minimum external permissions required by its sources.

## Common tasks

1. **Review reusable identities.**
    1. Open **Global Identities**.
    2. Review the identities available for workspace connectors and sync sources.
    3. Confirm owner, purpose, and external permissions outside SimpleChat.
    Outcome to verify: Only approved identities are reused by sources.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

2. **Prepare an identity for File Sync.**
    1. Create or update the identity outside this tab.
    2. Return to File Sync and assign it to a source.
    3. Run the source test or a small sync.
    Outcome to verify: The source authenticates through the intended shared identity.
