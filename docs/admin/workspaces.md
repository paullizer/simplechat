## What this tab controls

Controls personal, group, and public workspace availability, downloads, workflows, file uploads, metadata, classification, retention, and agreements.

## Why it matters

Workspace settings define the tenant's data boundaries: personal, group, public, workflow, file download, retention, classification, and agreement behavior. Enabling a scope creates new places where documents and conversations can live; disabling or role-gating a scope changes what users can see or create. Retention and download settings directly affect compliance and data-loss risk.

### Retention policy

Retention settings define default cleanup windows for conversations and documents by workspace type. Use `none` when users or workspace owners control retention manually; choose day-based defaults only after confirming records policy.

### User agreement

The user agreement can apply to personal, group, public, and chat surfaces. Use it when users need to acknowledge workspace-specific handling terms, and decide whether daily reacceptance is required before enabling it.

### Role-gated workspace actions

Role requirements such as CreateGroups, CreatePublicWorkspaces, WorkflowUser, and ChatFileUploadUser restrict capabilities after sign-in. Assign the Entra app roles before enabling the corresponding requirement to avoid blocking intended users.

### Collaborative conversations

`enable_collaborative_conversations` is enforced by collaboration backend routes rather than a visible field in `admin_settings.html`. When it is on, SimpleChat can use the collaboration conversation, message, and user-state containers. Turning it off blocks collaboration endpoints, so verify existing collaborative conversations and user expectations before disabling it.

## Before you change anything

- Decide which scopes are allowed: personal, group, public, workflows, and chat uploads.
- Create Entra app roles before enabling requirements such as `CreateGroups`, `CreatePublicWorkspaces`, `WorkflowUser`, or `ChatFileUploadUser`.
- Review retention requirements before setting default document or conversation retention.
- Configure embeddings, AI Search, and Document Intelligence before promoting document-heavy workspace use.

## Common tasks

1. **Enable workspace scopes.**
    1. Enable **Personal Workspaces**, **Group Workspaces**, or **Public Workspaces** according to policy.
    2. For public workspaces, set **End-user display name** if the tenant uses another label.
    3. Save and verify navigation with a normal user account.
    Outcome to verify: Only approved workspace scopes appear.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

2. **Restrict creation and upload actions.**
    1. Create the needed Entra app roles first.
    2. Enable **Require CreateGroups App Role**, **Require CreatePublicWorkspaces App Role**, **Require WorkflowUser App Role**, or **Require ChatFileUploadUser App Role**.
    3. Save and test with one assigned and one unassigned user.
    Outcome to verify: Role-gated actions are available only to assigned users.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

3. **Set retention defaults.**
    1. Enable retention for personal, group, or public workspaces.
    2. Choose conversation and document retention defaults for each enabled scope.
    3. Set **Scheduled Execution Time**.
    4. Save and review workspace retention behavior.
    Outcome to verify: New defaults match the retention policy.

Show the relevant controls and redact secrets." %}

4. **Enable user agreements.**
    1. Enable **User Agreement**.
    2. Choose where it applies: personal, group, public, and/or chat.
    3. Enter **Agreement Text**.
    4. Decide whether **Allow users to accept once per day** is needed.
    Outcome to verify: Users see the agreement on the selected surfaces.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users cannot create groups | Group creation is disabled or the CreateGroups role requirement is enabled. | Enable group creation or assign the CreateGroups app role. |
