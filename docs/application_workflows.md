These flows are the fastest way to understand where Simple Chat applies safety checks, where Azure services participate, and where document-grounded answers actually come from.

## Content Safety Workflow

![Workflow - Content Safety](./images/workflow-content_safety.png)

1. A user sends a message from the chat interface.
2. If Content Safety is enabled, the message is evaluated before it reaches the target backend service.
3. Azure AI Content Safety evaluates configured categories such as hate, sexual content, violence, and self-harm, and can also apply custom blocklists.
4. If the message passes, the system routes it to the intended destination.
5. If the message fails, the request is blocked and the user receives a generic notification. Details can be logged for administrators when that feature is enabled.

When a prompt is considered safe, it can continue into one of several paths:

- Retrieval-backed chat that queries Azure AI Search.
- Direct GPT interaction against Azure OpenAI.
- Image generation against a configured DALL-E deployment.

The default flow protects the inbound user message. Downstream services may still apply their own filtering behavior after that point.

## Add Your Data Workflow

This workflow covers what happens when users upload content into personal or group workspaces for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

![Add your data - Workflow](./images/workflow-add_your_data.png)

1. Users upload one or more supported files through the application UI.
2. The backend determines file type and chooses the correct extraction path.
3. Text is extracted through Azure AI Document Intelligence, Azure Video Indexer, Azure Speech Service, or internal parsers depending on the content type.
4. Extracted content is chunked into retrieval-friendly segments while preserving structural context such as pages, timestamps, tables, or sequence.
5. Each chunk is embedded through the configured Azure OpenAI embedding model.
6. The chunk text, embedding vector, and retrieval metadata are written to Azure AI Search.
7. Parent document records and processing metadata are written to Cosmos DB so the system can relate the original file to its indexed chunks.
8. Once indexing completes, the document becomes available to hybrid retrieval in chat and workspace search.

Typical chunk metadata includes document identity, filename, workspace scope, sequence numbers, page references, timestamps, and optional classification or extraction metadata.

## Mixed-Source Document Actions

When mixed-source flags are enabled, Chat and workflow Search remain relevance bounded. Analyze and Compare resolve an ordered authorized manifest, dispatch narrative documents to bounded window analysis and CSV/Excel documents to native tabular tools, and combine only bounded evidence summaries.

Every selected or planned source ends with `completed`, `partial`, `failed`, or `skipped` plus a bounded reason. Analyze reduces only when at least one source succeeds. Compare requires a prepared Source and can continue past a failed Target. Cancellation stops active branches and prevents later reduction, citation/artifact publication, and assistant response persistence.

The staged Analyze All backend enumerates current documents through the ready document access index and rejects catalogs above the configured workflow Analyze limit. Every enumerated ID is reauthorized before execution. This stage remains default off and is not newly exposed in the workflow selector in version **0.250.070**.
