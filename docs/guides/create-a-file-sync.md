## What this does

File Sync creates a source that imports files from an approved external location into a personal, group, or public workspace. This guide chooses a source type, connection, filters, tags, delete policy, and optional schedule.

                      capture="Recording planned. Show create a file sync end to end and explain why this task helps a user." %}

## Why you would use this

Use File Sync when important documents already live in a share or storage container and should stay current without repeated uploads. It replaces manual drag-and-drop for stable repositories; it is the wrong choice for temporary files, unapproved repositories, or sources too broad for the workspace.

## Before you start

- Admins must enable `enable_file_sync` and the target scope toggle: `enable_file_sync_personal`, `enable_file_sync_group`, or `enable_file_sync_public`; see [File Sync settings]({{ '/admin/file-sync/' | relative_url }}).
- The workspace scope must be enabled on [Workspaces settings]({{ '/admin/workspaces/' | relative_url }}).
- You need permission to manage sync sources and a readable credential or **Reusable identity**.

## Steps

1. Open the workspace that should receive synced documents.
2. Choose **Sync** from **Section** or the workspace tabs.
3. Select **Add Sync Source**.

{% include media.html src="guides/create-a-file-sync-step-3.png"
                      alt="Screenshot showing create a file sync step 3."
                      title="Create a file sync step 3"
                      capture="Capture the create a file sync task at this step in SimpleChat with realistic sample data and redact secrets." %}

4. On **1. Source Type**, choose **SMB Share**, **Azure Files**, **Azure Blob Storage**, or another available card.
5. Select **Configure Source**.
6. In **General**, enter **Source name** and connection fields such as **UNC path**, **File service URL**, **Share name**, **Container name**, or **Blob prefix**.
7. In **Identity and Authentication**, choose **Reusable identity** or source-local credentials.
8. In **Selection, Subfolders, and Filters**, choose paths, subfolders, patterns, and file types.
9. In **Tags**, choose fixed tags; in **Sync Schedule**, enable **Scheduled sync** only when automatic refresh is wanted.

{% include media.html src="guides/create-a-file-sync-step-9.png"
                      alt="Screenshot showing create a file sync step 9."
                      title="Create a file sync step 9"
                      capture="Capture the create a file sync task at this step in SimpleChat with realistic sample data and redact secrets." %}

10. Select **Test Connection**, then **Add Source** or **Save Source**.

## Verify it worked

The source appears in the Sync list. Imported files later appear on the workspace **Documents** tab with fixed or folder tags.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No source types are visible | Admins have not made a source type visible | Ask an admin to review File Sync source type visibility. |
| **Include subfolders** is disabled | Recursive sources are disabled by admin policy | Sync a top-level path or ask whether recursion is allowed. |
| **Test Connection** fails | The credential, path, container, or share is wrong | Correct the fields and retest. |
