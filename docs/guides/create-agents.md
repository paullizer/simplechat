Create agents around a specific job to be done, not around a vague persona. The most reliable agents in Simple Chat have narrow instructions, deliberate tool access, and a test set that proves they behave the way you expect.

## Minimum viable agent setup

1. Write a single-sentence mission for the agent.
2. Decide whether the agent should be global, group-scoped, or personal.
3. Add instructions that define what the agent should do, what it should avoid, and when it should ask for clarification.
4. Attach only the actions, knowledge sources, or workspace access needed for that mission.
5. Test the agent with representative prompts before broader rollout.

## Scope decisions

- Use **global agents** when the same capability should be shared across the whole deployment.
- Use **group agents** when the behavior, documents, or actions are tied to one team or workspace.
- Use **personal agents** when users need private experimentation or individualized tool combinations.

## Prompt and tool design rules

- Prefer specific instructions over aspirational descriptions.
- Tell the agent what evidence or citations it should rely on when grounded answers matter.
- Avoid attaching write-capable actions unless the workflow truly needs them.
- Give the agent permission to decline when the request falls outside its domain.

## Validation checklist

- Test a prompt the agent should answer well.
- Test a prompt it should refuse or redirect.
- Test a prompt that exercises each attached action.
- Review whether the agent cites the correct workspace content or asks for missing context when needed.
