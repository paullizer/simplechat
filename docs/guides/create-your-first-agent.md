Agents are most useful when they are specific. This tutorial shows how to define that specificity in instructions, data access, and testing rather than relying on a generic assistant prompt.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are specialized AI assistants that you can customize for specific tasks, roles, or domains. They can:
- Have custom personalities and communication styles
- Access specific sets of documents and knowledge
- Follow particular instructions or workflows
- Be shared with specific users or groups

Think of agents as different "experts" you can consult - like having a financial analyst, technical writer, or customer service representative always available.

## Step 1: Access Agent Management

1. **Navigate to the Agents section** in Simple Chat
2. **Click "Create New Agent"** or the "+" button
3. You'll see the agent creation interface

## Step 2: Configure Basic Agent Settings

### Agent Identity
1. **Name your agent**: Choose a clear, descriptive name
   - Good examples: "Financial Analyst", "Technical Documentation Helper", "Customer Support Bot"
   - Avoid generic names like "Agent 1"

2. **Add a description**: Explain what this agent does
   - Example: "Analyzes financial reports and provides insights on budget performance and trends"

3. **Choose an avatar/icon** (if available): Visual representation helps users understand the agent's purpose

### Agent Instructions (System Prompt)

This is where you define your agent's personality and capabilities:

```
You are a Financial Analyst Agent specializing in budget analysis and financial reporting. 

Your role:
- Analyze financial documents and spreadsheets
- Provide insights on budget performance, trends, and variances
- Explain financial concepts in clear, business-friendly language
- Recommend actionable next steps based on data

Your personality:
- Professional but approachable
- Detail-oriented and analytical
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Always provide specific examples and evidence

When responding:
1. Start with a brief summary of your findings
2. Provide detailed analysis with specific numbers
3. Highlight key concerns or opportunities
4. Suggest concrete next steps
```

## Step 3: Configure Agent Knowledge

### Workspace Access
1. **Select workspaces** the agent can access:
   - Your personal workspace
   - Specific group workspaces
   - Public workspaces (if available)

2. **Choose relevant documents**:
   - Financial reports for a Financial Analyst agent
   - Technical docs for a Documentation agent
   - Product catalogs for a Sales agent

### Knowledge Scope
Consider what information your agent needs:
- **Broad access**: Good for general-purpose agents
- **Focused access**: Better for specialized agents to avoid confusion

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

### Initial Testing
1. **Save your agent configuration**
2. **Start a new conversation** with your agent
3. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Ask about the agent's role: "What can you help me with?"
   - Test knowledge access: "What documents do you have access to?"
   - Try a representative task

### Example Test Conversation

**You**: "Hello! What can you help me with?"

**Agent**: "Hi! I'm your Financial Analyst Agent. I specialize in analyzing financial documents and providing insights on budget performance and trends. I can help you with:
- Budget variance analysis
- Financial report interpretation  
- Trend identification and forecasting
- ROI calculations and recommendations

What financial questions can I help you explore today?"

**You**: "Can you analyze our Q3 budget performance?"

**Agent**: *[Searches relevant financial documents and provides analysis]*

## Step 5: Refine and Improve

Based on your testing, you might need to adjust:

### Common Adjustments
- **Instructions too broad**: Make them more specific
- **Agent too formal/informal**: Adjust personality in system prompt
- **Wrong knowledge access**: Modify workspace permissions
- **Responses off-topic**: Refine the role definition

### Iterative Improvement
1. Test with real use cases
2. Note what works and what doesn't
3. Update instructions and configuration
4. Test again

## Step 6: Share Your Agent (Optional)

If your agent works well:
1. **Configure sharing settings**
2. **Add team members** who can access the agent
3. **Provide usage guidelines** for your team

## Real-World Agent Examples

```

### Customer Service Agent
```
You are a Customer Service Agent dedicated to helping users with product questions and support issues.

## Best Practices for Agent Creation

### Do's
- ✅ Give agents specific, clear roles
- ✅ Test thoroughly before sharing
- ✅ Update instructions based on feedback
- ✅ Provide relevant document access
- ✅ Use consistent personality and tone

### Don'ts
- ❌ Make instructions too vague or generic
- ❌ Give access to irrelevant documents
- ❌ Create agents that duplicate existing functionality
- ❌ Forget to test edge cases
- ❌ Leave agents without clear purpose

## What You've Accomplished

Congratulations! You've successfully:
✅ Created a custom agent with specific expertise  
✅ Configured agent personality and behavior  
✅ Set up appropriate knowledge access  
✅ Tested and refined your agent  
✅ Learned agent best practices

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first agent:
- [Upload and organize more documents]({{ '/guides/upload-and-manage-documents/' | relative_url }}) to expand agent knowledge
- [Classify documents]({{ '/guides/classify-documents/' | relative_url }}) to help agents find relevant information
- Create additional agents for different use cases
- Explore [advanced agent configuration]({{ '/guides/create-agents/' | relative_url }}) options

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not finding relevant information?**
- Check workspace access permissions
- Verify documents are properly uploaded and processed
- Make sure agent instructions are specific enough

**Agent responses too generic?**
- Add more specific instructions about tone and approach
- Include examples of desired responses
- Narrow the agent's knowledge scope

**Agent not staying in character?**
- Strengthen the personality section in instructions
- Add reminders about the agent's role
- Test with edge cases to identify instruction gaps
