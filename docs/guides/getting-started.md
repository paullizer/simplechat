## Step 1: Deploy Simple Chat

Simple Chat offers multiple deployment options. For getting started, we recommend using the automated deployment:

### Option A: Azure Developer CLI (Recommended for beginners)

The fastest way to get started is with Azure Developer CLI:

1. Install Azure Developer CLI if you haven't already
2. Clone the Simple Chat repository
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the deployment command

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/simplechat.git
cd simplechat

# Deploy with azd
azd up
```

Follow the prompts to select your subscription, region, and provide required configuration.

### Option B: Other Deployment Methods

For more deployment options, see our [deployment reference](../reference/deploy/index.md).

## Step 2: Initial Configuration

After deployment completes:

1. **Open the application** using the URL provided in the deployment output
2. **Sign in** with your Azure Active Directory account
3. **Access Admin Settings** (if you have admin role assigned)

### Configure Basic Settings

In the Admin Settings page:

1. **General Section**: 
   - Set your application title
   - Upload a custom logo (optional)
   
2. **GPT Section**:
   - Verify your Azure OpenAI connection
   - Test the connection using the "Test" button
   - Select your active model deployment

3. **Embeddings Section**:
   - Verify your embeddings endpoint
   - Test the connection

## Step 3: Enable Your First Workspace

1. In Admin Settings, navigate to **Workspaces**
2. Enable **"Your Workspace"** - this allows personal document uploads
3. Click **Save Configuration**

## Step 4: Upload Your First Document

Now let's add some content to work with:

1. **Navigate to "Your Workspace"** from the main menu
2. **Click "Add Documents"**
3. **Select a file** from your computer:
   - Try a PDF with interesting content
   - Word documents work great too
   - Text files are supported
4. **Upload the document** and wait for processing

You'll see the document appear in your workspace with processing status indicators.

## Step 5: Start Your First RAG Conversation

Now for the exciting part - chatting with your document:

1. **Go to "Chat"** from the main menu
2. **Select your workspace** from the workspace dropdown
3. **Ask a question** about your document content

Try questions like:
- "What are the main topics covered in this document?"
- "Can you summarize the key points?"
- "What does the document say about [specific topic]?"

## Step 6: Explore Citations

Notice how Simple Chat provides citations showing where information came from:

- **Standard citations** show which document and chunk
- **Enhanced citations** (if enabled) can link directly to pages
