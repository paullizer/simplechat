These guides are best read as a family. Start with the single-agent integration if you want the fastest path, move into OAuth when you need production authentication, then use the advanced guides only when your permissions or workflows demand more separation.

        <h2>Single-agent ServiceNow integration</h2>
        <p>Use the standard support-agent guide for incident management and read-only KB search through one agent and two actions.</p>

        <h2>OAuth 2.0 setup</h2>
        <p>Use the OAuth guide when you need bearer-token authentication instead of Basic Auth for ServiceNow actions in production-style environments.</p>

        <h2>Two-agent KB management</h2>
        <p>Use the advanced split-agent design when incident handling and KB publishing need separate roles, tokens, and approval boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Asset management agent</h2>
        <p>Use the asset-management guide when you want a dedicated agent with separate query, create, update, and delete actions over the `alm_asset` table.</p>

<div class="latest-release-note-panel">
    <h2>Pick the narrowest integration that fits</h2>
    <p>Most teams should start with the single-agent support pattern. Add OAuth when security posture requires it, add the two-agent KB model when permissions diverge, and add asset management only when hardware lifecycle workflows belong inside the agent surface.</p>

        <p>The ServiceNow folder includes incident, knowledge-base, and asset-management specs for the actions described in these guides.</p>

        <p>Instruction files for the support, KB management, and asset-management agents live beside the specs so action and prompt behavior stay aligned.</p>
