## What this action does

Runs read-only Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL queries and validates Cosmos SQL-style queries.

## Why and when to use it

Use it for governed lookup over one Cosmos container. Use SQL Query for relational databases.

## Before you start

- Cosmos endpoint, database, container, partition key path, and managed identity or account key.
- Users also need access to the action through workspace or governance policy where applicable.

## Configuration overview

Set account/container fields, auth method, optional field hints, max items, timeout, and test the connection.
