## What this action does

Discovers Azure Log Analytics table schemas and runs read-only KQL queries against one workspace.

## Why and when to use it

Use it for operational telemetry and App Insights-style investigation. Use SQL/Snowflake/Databricks for business data.

## Before you start

- Workspace ID plus identity, user, service principal, or key access.
- Users also need access to the action through workspace or governance policy where applicable.

## Configuration overview

Set Workspace ID, Cloud, optional endpoints, Authentication Method, and test the connection.
