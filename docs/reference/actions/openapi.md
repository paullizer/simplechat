## What this action does

OpenAPI turns a YAML or JSON OpenAPI specification into callable operations. The action can list available APIs, inspect operation details, and call operations by `operationId` with configured authentication.

## Why and when to use it

Use OpenAPI when an HTTP API has a maintained OpenAPI spec and users need agents to call multiple documented operations. Do not use it for arbitrary web pages or PDFs; use Smart HTTP. Do not use it for MCP servers; use MCP. Tool-call quality depends on clear operation IDs and parameter schemas.

## Before you start

- An OpenAPI specification file in YAML or JSON, max 5 MB according to the modal help.
- API **Base URL**, auto-populated from the spec when available but editable.
- Authentication details: no auth, API key, bearer token, basic auth, OAuth2 access token, or compatible reusable identity.
- Agents/actions enabled with [`enable_semantic_kernel`]({{ '/admin/agents/' | relative_url }}).

## Configure the action

1. Choose **OpenAPI**.
2. Upload **OpenAPI Specification File**.
3. Review or edit **Base URL**.
4. Read the **API Information** panel after parsing.
5. Choose **Authentication Type**: **No Authentication**, **API Key**, bearer token, **Basic Auth**, or **OAuth2**.
6. For API key auth, choose **Location**, fill **Key Name**, and fill **API Key**.
7. For bearer, basic, or OAuth2 auth, fill the shown token, username/password, or access token fields.
8. Use **Test Connection**.

## Example prompts

- "List the available API operation IDs for this action."
- "Call the customer status endpoint for account 12345 and summarize the response."
- "Get operation details for createIncident before using it."

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operation names are hard for the agent to choose | The spec has missing or ambiguous operation IDs. | Improve operation IDs and summaries, then re-upload. |
| Authentication fails | Wrong auth type, header name, token, or query parameter is configured. | Match modal auth fields to the API security scheme. |
| Spec upload fails | File is invalid JSON/YAML or too large. | Validate the spec and keep it under the documented upload limit. |
