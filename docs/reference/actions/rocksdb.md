## What this action does

Reads and optionally writes keys through a RocksDB HTTP/JSON service with prefix/range scans.

## Why and when to use it

Use it for low-level key-value lookup behind an approved service. Keep read-only unless writes are reviewed.

## Before you start

- RocksDB service URL and optional bearer/API key auth.
- Users also need access to the action through workspace or governance policy where applicable.

## Configuration overview

Set Service Base URL, Authentication Scheme, Column Family, Read-Only, encodings, prefix hints, and limits.

Shared wizard steps: [Common action setup steps](../#common-action-setup-steps).
