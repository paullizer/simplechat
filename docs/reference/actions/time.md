Provides time-related functions with invocation logging.

## Why and when to use it

Use it when an agent needs current time or time calculations as a tool.

## Before you start

- No credentials; controlled by `enable_time_plugin`.
- Users also need access to the action through workspace or governance policy where applicable.

## Configuration overview

No service-specific configuration beyond enabling/assigning the action.
