## What this action does

Provides wait/sleep behavior with invocation logging.

## Why and when to use it

Use it only in workflows or tool chains that intentionally pause between operations.

## Before you start

- No credentials; controlled by `enable_wait_plugin`.
- Users also need access to the action through workspace or governance policy where applicable.

## Configuration overview

No service-specific configuration beyond enabling/assigning the action.

Shared wizard steps: [Common action setup steps](../#common-action-setup-steps).
