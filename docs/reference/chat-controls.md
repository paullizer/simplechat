## How to use this reference

Use this page when you can see a control in Chat but are not sure what it does or when to use it. The generated inventory lists 47 real controls plus 3 child sub-elements. The child elements `document-comparison-edit-btn-label`, `fork-conversation-button-label`, and `fork-conversation-button-spinner` are mentioned with their parent controls instead of receiving separate rows.

## Conversation list
