The Bicep templates are the infrastructure backbone behind the repo's recommended deployment flow. Most teams should still apply them through AZD, but this page is where you orient yourself when you need to inspect or customize the infrastructure directly.

				<h2>Remember the runtime model</h2>
				<p>The supported Bicep path still lands on container-based App Service, so startup behavior follows the container entrypoint rather than native Python app settings.</p>

		<h2>Use Bicep as the infrastructure layer, not a separate platform story</h2>
		<p>In this repo, Bicep is best understood as the IaC layer beneath AZD rather than a competing deployment experience. Start from the AZD guide unless your goal is specifically to inspect or change the infrastructure modules themselves.</p>
</div>

## When to choose this path

- You want to inspect or customize the Bicep templates in `deployers/bicep/`
- You want to understand the infrastructure used by the `azd` deployment flow
- You are troubleshooting infrastructure behavior or preparing Bicep module changes

## Recommended workflow

1. Start with the [Azure Developer CLI deployment guide](./azd-cli_deploy.md).
2. Review or modify the Bicep files under `deployers/bicep/`.
3. Use `azd provision --preview` or `azd up` to apply those changes through the supported workflow.
