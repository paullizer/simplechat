This section is the deployment decision map. Use it after you already understand the basics and need the path-specific guidance for the rollout model your team actually uses.

				<h2>Azure Developer CLI</h2>
				<p>The most current and best-supported path. Use it when you want provisioning, configuration, and deployment handled in one repo-aligned workflow.</p>

				<div class="latest-release-card-icon"><i class="bi bi-terminal"></i></div>
				<h2>Azure CLI with PowerShell</h2>
				<p>Use this when you want a script-driven deployment flow with more control over sequencing and recovery than the default AZD experience.</p>

				<h2>Bicep and Terraform</h2>
				<p>Use these when infrastructure-as-code ownership is the main concern and your team needs more direct control over templates or state.</p>

				<h2>Manual native Python notes</h2>
				<p>Use the manual notes only when you are intentionally operating a native Python App Service deployment rather than the repo's container deployers.</p>

<div class="latest-release-note-panel">
		<h2>Pick the runtime model first</h2>
		<p>The most important split is not AZD versus Terraform. It is container-based App Service versus native Python App Service. The repo's main deployment paths are container-based, and that changes startup-command handling, upgrade flow, and rollback expectations.</p>
