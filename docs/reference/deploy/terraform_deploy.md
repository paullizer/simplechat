Use Terraform when state-managed infrastructure is already your team standard and you are comfortable separating image publication from infrastructure application.

<div class="latest-release-note-panel">
		<h2>Terraform is not the image build step</h2>
		<p>The most common mistake with this path is assuming Terraform also handles the application image lifecycle. It does not. Treat image publication and infrastructure application as two separate steps in the release flow.</p>
</div>

## When to choose this path

- Your team standardizes on Terraform state and workflows
- You want Terraform-managed infrastructure rather than `azd` orchestration
- You are comfortable publishing the application image before applying infrastructure

## Runtime model

The current Terraform deployer in this repo provisions a **container-based Azure Linux Web App**.

## Current behavior

- Terraform sets the App Service to run the published container image.
- Gunicorn startup is already handled by the container entrypoint in `application/single_app/Dockerfile`.
- You do **not** need to configure App Service Stack Settings Startup command for the current Terraform deployment.

## If you switch Terraform to native Python later

If you change the Terraform deployment model away from containers and into native Python App Service, deploy the `application/single_app` folder and use this Startup command:

```bash
python -m gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py app:app
```
