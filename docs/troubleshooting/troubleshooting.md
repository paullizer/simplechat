Most support work on Simple Chat starts with one question: is the failure in the app layer, in telemetry wiring, or in a downstream Azure dependency? This page gives the shortest path to answer that question.

## OpenTelemetry Settings

- [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry distribution](https://pypi.org/project/azure-monitor-opentelemetry/)
- [OpenTelemetry SDK environment variable reference](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/)

## Backend Call Failing

Simple Chat uses Flask instrumentation by default, and backend calls are logged to Application Insights. Start with the `requests` table to find the failing call, capture the `operation_Id`, and use that identifier to pivot into related exceptions.

### Query failed requests

```kusto
requests
| where success == false
```

### Query most recent exceptions

```kusto
exceptions
| top 10 by timestamp
```

### Query exceptions associated with a specific `operation_Id`

```kusto
exceptions
| where operation_Id == '61a97b6a6ddc11b465b5289738bddcf1'
```

## Flask Instrumentation Startup Error

If startup logs show an error while Flask instrumentation is initializing, disable it with the `DISABLE_FLASK_INSTRUMENTATION` environment variable. Set the value to `1` or `true`, then restart the app service so the process starts cleanly without the instrumentation hook.

## Mixed-Source Partial Coverage

A mixed-source answer may complete with partial coverage when one narrative retrieval, table tool call, authorization check, or comparison Target cannot complete. This is expected fail-closed behavior: a failed table is not silently treated as narrative text, and prior conversation evidence does not fill a gap in the current selection.

1. Review the response coverage summary for completed, partial, failed, and skipped source counts.
2. Confirm the relevant mixed-source mode flag is enabled and subordinate rollout flags are not being assumed.
3. Recheck personal ownership or approved sharing, group membership, public visibility, and chat-upload conversation ownership.
4. For Analyze All, confirm the document access index is ready and the authorized catalog does not exceed the configured workflow Analyze limit.
5. If aggregate development telemetry is enabled, correlate `MixedSourceTelemetry` events by `request_correlation_id` and inspect only counts, mode, status, cancellation phase, and latency. Source content or identity should never appear.

If cancellation occurs, no final assistant response or new generated artifact should be published. A background tabular export that was already queued is canceled through its existing export run status.
